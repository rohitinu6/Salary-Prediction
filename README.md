# Salary Prediction based on Country and Race

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts salaries using machine learning models based on factors such as country, race, and demographic details. The goal is to analyze salary disparities and identify key predictors of income.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Machine learning model implementation
- Model evaluation and performance analysis
- Visualization of salary trends

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📚 Dataset

The dataset includes variables such as:

- **Country**
- **Race**
- **Education Level**
- **Years of Experience**
- **Job Title**
- **Salary**

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 🔥 Results

Models are evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared values. The best-performing model provides insights into salary variations.
